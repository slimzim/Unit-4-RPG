# Unit-4-RPG

## Overview

This is a turn-based role playing game I created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.  This was a tremendous undertaking for me at the time as I was new to JavaScript programming logic and updating the DOM using jQuery.  The characters are classmates of mine from my coding class, and the weapons are all inside jokes!
